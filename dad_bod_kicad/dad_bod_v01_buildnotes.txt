build notes 07/22/22

center up headers, they're the wrong gender

route 3pin switches to reflect capacitor 
	(jumper towards cap)

center banana jacks
	space them out put 2 mounting holes in between

install pass thru header on bottom of board

divider network can be closer each other

put smd on underside

change footprint of ltc6268 to 8 pin




bandwidth requirement < 20MHz
AC power, most transients of interest < 60kHz


move all bypass power caps way closer to the IC power pins
	c22 c28 c27 etc
	c44-48

db_standalone_v01 has 1k 1% resistors for R36, R18 (mouser shorted)

add test points, in way of header strips


power supply had mis-net near V- on op-amp w/ C49
