build notes 07/22/22

center up headers, they're the wrong gender

route 3pin switches to reflect capacitor 
	(jumper towards cap)

center banana jacks
	space them out put 2 mounting holes in between

install pass thru header on bottom of board

divider network can be closer each other

put smd on underside

change footprint of ltc6268 to 8 pin




bandwidth requirement < 20MHz
AC power, most transients of interest < 60kHz


move all bypass power caps way closer to the IC power pins
	c22 c28 c27 etc
	c44-48

db_standalone_v01 has 1k 1% resistors for R36, R18 (mouser shorted)

add test points, in way of header strips


power supply had mis-net near V- on op-amp w/ C49



beach_bod_01
r23 r25 0603


first gain stage
feedback R & C very close, minimum trace width
amp outs wide and short (minimize capacitance over ground plane

psu gets a greg plane underneath

two vias side by side (parallel) halves the inductance

02-27-23 DADBOD
will now be a focused break out board
for the digilient analog discovery 2

female header

gets all its power from the dad2
no usbc

two sets of inputs

1] banana jacks: 	Divider network
			HPF PLC [Plucker]

2] banana jacks:	Divider network
			BNC in

send inputs to relays first [duh?]
***
not duh, makes more sense for the circuits to always get the signal on the front end
instead of at the scope

at least that makes sense to me, but maybe it's not an issue either way
***


the gndref for the divider networks might not even need to be there
should do an experiment on the breadboard
with the wavegen from the dad2

build a simple divider,
test with a middle gnd point to the dad2 gnd
and without
