Beach_bod psu section testing on the breadboard

An unknown coil is added in series on the positive rail.
A spare smd PMV65XPVL mosfet is installed as per schematic.

There are a decent number of 4" jumper wires still installed.


+5 Voltage input is being supplied via the Analog Discover 2's supply output

The psu outputs are measured against the AD's supply output

See 5Vin_negrail.png & 5Vin_posrail.png


Spectrum analysis shows both rails having a spike, with an average of +10dBV around ~136kHz 
using the exponential RMS Average over a wide range

The rails are at 10dBV until experiencing a cutoff beginning at 500Hz, leveling off at 2kHz to -90dBV
