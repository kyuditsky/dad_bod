Sinewaves

distortion increases as Vin & freq increase
1MHz @ 1mVin
50kHz @ 3Vin
20k @ 4Vin

freq higher than that, transforms into a triangle

at 5Vin, the sine gets clipped close to the rails (4.85 vs 5.06) Peak2Peak


Square waves increase slope as freq increases
500Hz @ 1Vin

10kHz @ 3Vin = 0.1ms

rising/falling edge spikes increase as Vin decreases


feb 18 23
added capacitors c12-16
from signal to gnd ref

sine 5Vin
less than 5kHz, clips at rails
5kHz-2MHz maintains signal waveform
noise increases dramatically as freq increases > 5kHz

Square 5Vin

waveform falls apart > 2kHz

consistant fall/rise time: 60us
cause of wave distortion at higher freq


triangle 5Vin

clips < 1kHz
distorts waveform > 1kHz (rounds out)

4Vin 
doesnt clip
distorts > 1kHz (same as 5Vin)


RampUp 4Vin

Inverts Signal
~50us rise time @ 1kHz
this has an affect of rounding out the peak
rise time increases dramatically as freq increases

no sawtooth > 2kHz

***
look at relationship of freq & RMS/peak2peak
